  * \brief Example program for PulseBlasterESR-PRO boards
  * 
  * This demonstrates a simple pulse loop and also the short pulse feature.
  * 
  * All four BNC connectors are high for three clock periods (making use
  * of the short-pulse feature), then low for the duration of instruction 1,
  * or 20 ns. The BNC connectors are then held high for 40ns.  
  * All four BNC connectors are then low for 40ns and the program repeats.
  * 
  * The largest value for the delay field of the pb_inst is 850ns.
  * For longer delays, use the LONG_DELAY instruction.  The maximum value
  * for the data field of the LONG_DELAY is 1048576.  Even longer delays can
  * be achieved using the LONG_DELAY instruction inside of a loop.
  *
